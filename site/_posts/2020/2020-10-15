Hello folks ðŸ‘‹ The Octant team has been hard at work on the latest release, listening to your feedback through issues, and improving the product as a whole. Weâ€™ve appreciated the issues and PRâ€™s youâ€™ve filed, and weâ€™re looking to expand how we capture feedback and learn from our users. 

Stepping back, weâ€™ve felt the need not only to learn about how we can improve Octant, but to learn more about our users as a whole. We want to understand the why, the how, and the who of Octant through our userâ€™s perspectives. This will help to inform the Octant roadmap, prioritize features, and create a knowledge base of common workflows.

## How You Can Participate
Weâ€™ve launched the Octant Community Survey for you to share more about yourself, how you use Octant, and to share whatever feedback comes to mind. Your participation in the survey will be tremendously helpful.

Weâ€™re looking forward to hearing from you and learning more about how youâ€™re using Octant. For question or comments, please feel free to reach out to us on Slack at [#octant] (https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CM37M9FCG) or here on Github.

And if you can, please spread the word! A shareable link to the survey can be found here:
